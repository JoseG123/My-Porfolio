<h1>Jose Garcia</h1>
	<p>I was born in the USA and so I am consider a US citizen.But as a joke I like to say that I am half immigrant and half US citizen because my mother crossed the border being pregnant.I was born in Manhattan in the Mount Sinai Hospital.I have lived all my 15 years in the Bronx.I am into sneakers and for free time I like to play socccer with my friends.</p>
<ul>
	<li>One of my goals in life is to be able to collect more than 100 sneakers and have them in my collection.</li>
	<li>Another goal I have in life is to buy a house outside the city for my parents so once they are older they can live peacefully.</li>
</ul>
